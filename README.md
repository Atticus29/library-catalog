## User Stories

* As a librarian, I want to create read, update, delete, and list books in the catalog, so that we can keep track of our inventory.
* As a patron, I want to check a book out, so I can take it home with me.
* As a librarian, I want to set a limit for the number of books a person can check out at a time, and display an error message if they exceed it. (Hint: Use constants and exceptions)
* As a patron, I want to see a history of all the books I checked out, so that I can look up the name of that awesome sci-fi novel I read three years ago.
* As a patron, I want to know when a book I checked out is due, so that I know when to return it.
* As a librarian, I want to see a list of overdue books, so that I can call up the patron who checked them out and tell them to bring them back.
* As a patron, I want to see a big reminder at the top of the page if I currently have an overdue book.
* As a patron, I want to be able to renew a book at least twice before it's finally due. (Hint: Use a constant!)
* As a patron, I want to receive an error message if I can't renew my book again, so I know it didn't work.
* As a librarian, I want to see a list of only users with overdue books.
* As a patron, I want to receive an error message if I attempt to access the detail-view page for a book that no longer exists (ie: access a URL like localhost:4567/books/23, if the Book with an id of 23 has since been deleted.)
* As a librarian, I want to search for patrons by name, and see all the books they have out.
* As a librarian or patron, I want to search for a book by author or title, so that I can find a book when there are a lot of books in the library.
